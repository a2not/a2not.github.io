Wanted to leave some quotes so here we are.

## "There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings." -- Dostoevski

Pain is inevitable.

Life is a moral and spiritual challenge: that when pain or hardship comes, we should face it in a way that gives it meaning — with courage, humility, and integrity — rather than being broken or embittered by it.

To “be worthy of my sufferings” means to respond to suffering in a way that ennobles rather than degrades the soul.

## "Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it." -- Baruch Spinoza, Ethics

How will you show up in the face of your suffering? Seek value in it, or let it break you?

## "He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how." -- Friedrich Nietzsche

No matter what happens to you, you can endure it if you have a purpose or a reason to live.

I feel so fortunate to have my lovely wife. The memory of our life together gives me the strength to endure even the most difficult circumstances.
