One of the most inspiring talk in the video which I love was this. It gave me the self-esteem that makes me believe in myself.

> There are plenty of people that are out there that have done what I want to do, that came from less than what I came from.
> So I know it's possible, and knowing that they went through the season like this as well is kind of what keeps me going.

Loved the dialogue of being lost in the woods as well.
Nothing will happen if you're stuck in the woods other than you starve to death, so you start walking even if you'd find out later that you're going on a wrong direction.
It's a progress that you know you were wrong and it's only possible to find out and move forward by taking action.

> You find out by doing, not thinking.
